This is an attempt at extending the existing COD4 RCON by adding features such as:

- Remote reading of chat logs
- User command triggers
- More granular control on voting
- Auto-kick on excessive bad language
- Server message looping
- And anything else we can think up along the way.

Another thing we'll be trying to achieve is to transmit this data using minimal bandwidth, such that one could permanenly run a monitor on a mobile device without incurring excessive costs (mobile data here is charged at extortionate prices).
